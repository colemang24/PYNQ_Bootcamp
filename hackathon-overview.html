            <h2>Hackathon Overview</h2>
            <p class="text">
              The last two days of the bootcamp will have students working together in teams to design and build 
              a project using what they learned from the bootcamp in a hackathon-style format. 
            </p>

            <h3>What is a Hackathon?</h3>
            <p class="text">
              Hackathons are events where teams come together to collaborativly work on a creative and new project. 
              Studens will brainstorm a project, come up with possible solutions to their problem and will design a working prototype
              by the end of the hacklathon. Hackathons usually have some kind of theme and since this bootcamp is primarily focused 
              on AI and Machine Learning, this years theme will be Deploying AI in the Real World with AMD Technologies. 
              The hackathon will take place last two days of the bootcamp and on the final day of the camp each team will present their projects.

              Some notes about the showcase:
              <ul>
                <li> Exhibition style: Each team will have a table in the summit retreat where they will set up their project and presentation. 
                  Parents and judges will be able to walk around and look at and ask questions about each project.</li>
                <li> Teams will have 15 minutes to present their project to the judges during their assigned time slot.</li>
                <li> Students, feel free to walk around and look at other projects when you are not presenting to the judges. Just make sure to always have at least three people at the station.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
